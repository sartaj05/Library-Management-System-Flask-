*Library Management System
This Library Management System is a Python and Flask-based web application designed to help manage books, members, and borrowing records. It includes features for book and member management, borrowing and returning records, late fee calculations, and data visualization.

*Project Overview
The Library Management System streamlines library operations by automating book and member management, tracking borrowing and returning activities, and calculating late fees. The system also offers data visualization for insights on library trends.

*Features
Book Management: Add, update, delete books with validation to prevent duplicate entries.
Member Management: Register new members, remove, and view member details.
Borrow and Return Books: Record borrowing and return transactions, with late fees applied automatically.
Search and Filter: Search books by title or author.
Data Visualization: Graphical data on borrowing trends using Matplotlib.
Responsive UI: User-friendly design with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.


**Requirements
Make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.8+
Flask for the backend
SQLite as the database
Matplotlib for data visualization
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for frontend

*Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-link>
cd Library-Management-System
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up the database:

Rules and Conditions
Adding Books: Book names must be unique. Attempting to add a duplicate book will show a validation error.
Member Registration: Each member has a unique member ID.
Borrowing and Returning Books: Late fees are automatically calculated if a book is returned late at a rate of $1 per day.
Data Visualization: The application uses Matplotlib to show borrowing patterns and other insights.
Responsive Design: The interface is mobile-friendly and adapts to different screen sizes.
